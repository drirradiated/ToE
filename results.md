# Results and Findings

## Overview
This framework explores how fractional dynamics influence anomalous diffusion. The following results demonstrate the effects of varying fractional orders (\(\alpha\)) on system behaviour.

## Key Results

### 1. Rare Event at \(\alpha = 0.2\)
- **Observation**: A sharp positional jump occurs, suggesting a rare event driven by amplified memory effects.
- **Interpretation**: This behaviour may analogize singularities or critical transitions, such as the Big Bang.

### 2. Gradual Diffusion at \(\alpha = 0.5\)
- **Observation**: The system shows balanced, stable diffusion, with moderate memory effects.

### 3. Superdiffusion at \(\alpha = 0.8\)
- **Observation**: The system transitions smoothly, indicating weak memory effects and faster diffusion.

## Future Directions
1. **Parameter Exploration**: Investigate fractional orders \(\alpha < 0.2\) or \(\alpha > 0.8\).
2. **Noise Sensitivity**: Test how varying noise levels affect results.
3. **Real-World Applications**: Apply the framework to astrophysical or biological datasets.
