# ToE
A framework combining classical and quantum mechanics with fractional dimensions for modelling complex systems.

# Theory of Everything (ToE) Framework
Modelling fractional dynamics and anomalous diffusion to study rare events and singularities.

## Why This Matters
The ToE framework combines fractional calculus with physics to model systems with memory effects, bridging classical and quantum mechanics. Key features include:
- Fractional kernels for long-term dependencies.
- Simulations of rare events, such as singularities or critical transitions.
- Applications in astrophysics, biophysics, and beyond.

## Overview
This repository implements a hybrid **Theory of Everything (ToE)** model that integrates:
- Classical mechanics
- Quantum mechanics
- Fractional dimensions
