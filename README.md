# ToE
A framework combining classical and quantum mechanics with fractional dimensions for modelling complex systems.

# Theory of Everything Framework

## Overview
This repository implements a hybrid **Theory of Everything (ToE)** model that integrates:
- Classical mechanics
- Quantum mechanics
- Fractional dimensions

## Features
- **Fractional Calculus Solver**: Solve equations with fractional derivatives.
- **Applications**: Examples in cryptography, astrophysics, and biology.
